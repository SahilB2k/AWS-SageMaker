Bank Application ML Project - Readme
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker to predict customer behavior in a banking application. The model uses XGBoost to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various customer attributes.
Requirements

AWS Account with SageMaker access
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:

sagemaker
boto3
pandas
numpy

Workflow
1. Data Preparation

Download the bank customer dataset
Process and clean the data
Split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets

2. S3 Setup

Create an S3 bucket to store training data and model artifacts
Upload training and testing datasets to the bucket

3. Model Training

Configure the XGBoost algorithm with appropriate hyperparameters:

max_depth: 5
eta: 0.2
gamma: 4
min_child_weight: 6
subsample: 0.7
objective: binary
num_round: 50


Train the model using SageMaker's managed training infrastructure
Utilize spot instances for cost optimization

4. Model Deployment

Deploy the trained model as an endpoint for real-time inference
Set up the appropriate instance type (ml.m4.xlarge)

5. Model Evaluation

Make predictions on the test dataset
Create a confusion matrix to evaluate performance
Calculate classification metrics (overall accuracy: 89.7%)

6. Resource Cleanup

Delete the endpoint when not in use
Remove objects from S3 to avoid unnecessary storage costs

How to Run

Ensure you have the required permissions in your AWS account
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook notebooks/bank_prediction_model.ipynb
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook

Performance
The model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 89.7% on the test data.

True Negative: 10,785 cases (91% of actual negatives)
False Positive: 151 cases (34% of predicted positives)
False Negative: 1,124 cases (9% of actual negatives)
True Positive: 297 cases (66% of predicted positives)

Note
Remember to clean up resources after running the project to avoid unnecessary AWS charges.
